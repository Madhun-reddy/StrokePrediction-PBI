# StrokePrediction-PBI

## Bivariate Analysis

### Stroke occurrences based on Age high risk group(individual age >55 group as high risk):

**1.	Age High Risk and Stroke:**
**High-Risk Age Group:**
o	Individuals aged greater than 55 are considered high-risk.
o	This group includes 206 individuals who have experienced a stroke.
o	They account for 82.73% of all stroke cases in the dataset.
**Low-Risk Age Group:**
o	Individuals aged below 55 fall into the low-risk category.
o	Only 43 individuals in this group have had a stroke.
o	They represent 17.27% of stroke cases.

**Implications:**
o	The high-risk age segment faces a significantly higher risk of stroke.
o	Organizations and healthcare providers should focus on preventive measures and early detection for this demographic.
o	Lifestyle modifications, regular health check-ups, and awareness campaigns can help mitigate stroke risk.

### Stroke occurrences based on marital status

**2.	Marital Status and Stroke:**

	1753 individuals did not have a stroke.
	Currently married (Yes):
	203 individuals had a stroke.
	3336 individuals did not have a stroke.
	The total sample size is 5110 individuals.
	21 individuals who had stroke are from unspecified (NA) group

### Stroke occurrences based on Gender

**3.	Gender and Stroke:**
•	The dataset includes individuals categorized by gender: Female, Male, NA (Not Available), and Other.

o	The raw numbers indicate the following:
	Private jobs:
	2776 individuals did not have a stroke.
	145 individuals had a stroke.
	Self-employed:
	754 individuals did not have a stroke.
	64 individuals had a stroke.

## Category vs Target Analysis
Let’s analyze the insights and recommendations based on different categories compared to the target:

1.	Gender:
o	Female: 4.42% stroke rate.
o	Male: 5.02% stroke rate.
o	Other: 0.00% stroke rate.
o	Overall: 4.87% stroke rate.
o	Recommendation: Focus on preventive measures for both genders, with special attention to males.

2.	Marital Status:
o	Ever married: 6.09% stroke rate.
o	Never married: 1.43% stroke rate.
o	Overall: 4.87% stroke rate.
o	Recommendation: Prioritize preventive strategies for ever-married individuals.

3.	Residence Type:
o	Urban: 5.09% stroke rate.
o	Rural: 4.42% stroke rate.
o	Overall: 4.87% stroke rate.
o	Recommendation: Address urban lifestyle factors to reduce stroke risk.

4.	Age Risk:
o	High Risk Age (>55): 12% stroke rate.
o	Low Risk Age: 1% stroke rate.
o	Recommendation: Target health interventions for older populations.

5.	High-Risk Factors:
o	Individuals with high-risk factors have a significantly higher stroke rate.
o	Recommendation: Identify and mitigate these factors proactively.

6.	Heart Disease:
o	Individuals with heart disease face an extremely high stroke risk.
o	Recommendation: Manage and prevent heart diseases rigorously.

7.	Hypertension:
o	Hypertension significantly increases stroke risk.
o	Recommendation: Control blood pressure effectively.

## Insights:
1.	The high-risk age segment faces a significantly higher risk of stroke.
2.	Organizations and healthcare providers should focus on preventive measures and early detection for this demographic.
3.	Lifestyle modifications, regular health check-ups, and awareness campaigns can help mitigate stroke risk.
4.	Marital status appears to be associated with stroke risk.
5.	Individuals who are currently married have over 81% higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke compared to those who are never married is 10%.
6.	Females have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke compared to males.
7.	Job type may play a role in stroke prediction. So individuals in private jobs  had over 58% and those who are self-employed had 26% stroke and appear to have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke in these categories of workers.

## Continuous vs Target Analysis

**Continuous Variables Insights**
o	Age: Individuals who have had a stroke tend to be older on average.
o	BMI: There is a slight increase in average BMI for individuals who have had a stroke.
o	Glucose Level: Individuals with higher average glucose levels seem more prone to strokes.

**Recommendations:**
o	Age: Focus preventive measures on older adults as they are at higher risk.
o	BMI: Monitor and manage BMI to mitigate stroke risk.
o	Glucose Level: Control blood glucose levels effectively.
