# StrokePrediction-PBI

## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis focuses on analyzing one variable at a time. Let’s explore the insights from a univariate perspective based on the provided data

## Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis focuses on analyzing any concurrent relation between two variables or attributes. Let’s explore the insights from a bivariate perspective based on the provided data

### Stroke occurrences based on Age high risk group(individual age >55 group as high risk):

**1.	Age High Risk and Stroke:**

**High-Risk Age Group:**
-	Individuals aged greater than 55 are considered high-risk.
-	This group includes 206 individuals who have experienced a stroke.
-	They account for 82.73% of all stroke cases in the dataset.

**Low-Risk Age Group:**
-	Individuals aged below 55 fall into the low-risk category.
-	Only 43 individuals in this group have had a stroke.
-	They represent 17.27% of stroke cases.

**Implications:**
-	The high-risk age segment faces a significantly higher risk of stroke.
-	Organizations and healthcare providers should focus on preventive measures and early detection for this demographic.
-	Lifestyle modifications, regular health check-ups, and awareness campaigns can help mitigate stroke risk.

### Stroke occurrences based on marital status

**2.	Marital Status and Stroke:**
The dataset includes individuals categorized by their marital status: unspecified (NA), currently married (Yes), and never married (No).

The raw numbers indicate the following:
-	Never married (NA):
  -	25 individuals had a stroke.
  -	1753 individuals did not have a stroke.

-	Currently married (Yes):
  -	203 individuals had a stroke.
  -	3336 individuals did not have a stroke.
- The total sample size is 5110 individuals.
-	21 individuals who had stroke are from unspecified (NA) group

### Stroke occurrences based on Gender

**3.	Gender and Stroke:**
The dataset includes individuals categorized by gender: Female, Male, NA (Not Available), and Other.

The raw numbers indicate the following:

** Females:**
-	132 individuals had a stroke.
-	2985 individuals did not have a stroke.

** Males:**
-	106 individuals had a stroke.
-	2113 individuals did not have a stroke.

### Stroke occurrences based on different job types

**4.	Job Types and Stroke:**
The dataset includes individuals categorized by their job types: children, government jobs, NA (not available), never worked, private jobs, and self-employed.

The raw numbers indicate the following:

- Private jobs:
  -  2776 individuals did not have a stroke.
  -  145 individuals had a stroke.

- Self-employed:
  -  54 individuals did not have a stroke.
  -  64 individuals had a stroke.

## Category vs Target Analysis
Let’s analyze the insights and recommendations based on different categories compared to the target:

1.	Gender:

-	Female: 4.42% stroke rate.
-	Male: 5.02% stroke rate.
-	Other: 0.00% stroke rate.
-	Overall: 4.87% stroke rate.

**Recommendation:** Focus on preventive measures for both genders, with special attention to males.

2.	Marital Status:

-	Ever married: 6.09% stroke rate.
-	Never married: 1.43% stroke rate.
-	Overall: 4.87% stroke rate.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize preventive strategies for ever-married individuals.

3.	Residence Type:

- Urban: 5.09% stroke rate.
-	Rural: 4.42% stroke rate.
-	Overall: 4.87% stroke rate.

**Recommendation:** Address urban lifestyle factors to reduce stroke risk.

5.	Age Risk:

-	High Risk Age (>55): 12% stroke rate.
-	Low Risk Age: 1% stroke rate.

**Recommendation:** Target health interventions for older populations.

6.	High-Risk Factors:
   
- Individuals with high-risk factors have a significantly higher stroke rate.

**Recommendation:** Identify and mitigate these factors proactively.

7.	Heart Disease:
   
-	Individuals with heart disease face an extremely high stroke risk.

**Recommendation:** Manage and prevent heart diseases rigorously.

8.	Hypertension:
   
-	Hypertension significantly increases stroke risk.

**Recommendation:** Control blood pressure effectively.

## Insights:
1.	The high-risk age segment faces a significantly higher risk of stroke.
2.	Organizations and healthcare providers should focus on preventive measures and early detection for this demographic.
3.	Lifestyle modifications, regular health check-ups, and awareness campaigns can help mitigate stroke risk.
4.	Marital status appears to be associated with stroke risk.
5.	Individuals who are currently married have over 81% higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke compared to those who are never married is 10%.
6.	Females have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke compared to males.
7.	Job type may play a role in stroke prediction. So individuals in private jobs  had over 58% and those who are self-employed had 26% stroke and appear to have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke in these categories of workers.

## Continuous vs Target Analysis

**Continuous Variables Insights**
-	Age: Individuals who have had a stroke tend to be older on average.
-	BMI: There is a slight increase in average BMI for individuals who have had a stroke.
-	Glucose Level: Individuals with higher average glucose levels seem more prone to strokes.

**Recommendations:**
-	Age: Focus preventive measures on older adults as they are at higher risk.
-	BMI: Monitor and manage BMI to mitigate stroke risk.
-	Glucose Level: Control blood glucose levels effectively.
